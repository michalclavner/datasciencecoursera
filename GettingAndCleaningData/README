How the script "run_Analysis.R" works:

1. the script reads in 3 files from 2 separate folders within the main folder "UCI_HAR_DataSet" which is located in a "data" folder within my working directory (.\data\UCI_HAR_DataSet)
The 3 files being read are:
X_*.txt 
y_*.txt
subject_*.txt
( where the * denotes either "test" or "train")
2. As soon as 1 set of files is loaded into R, the program merges it to 1 data set, where the test datasets were concatenated below the train datasets.
3. variables names were assigned to the data sets. 
   subject_* : SubjectID
   Y_* : label ( numeric assignment from 1-6 for each activity)
   X_*: data ( the data in each variable for each observation)
4. 2 more files were loaded into R : activity labels ( which assigns       each numerical activity number with the name of the actual activity) and features ( which is the name of the 81 variables in the “X” data sets).
5. rename variables: 
 “labels” (Y_*) to “Activity Number”
 “subject_data” (subject_*) to “SubjectID”
 Each column of “data” (X_*) with the feature array
6. Merging the data sets into one data set such that:
Column 1- subject_ID
Column 2- activity number 
Columns 3:563 – the data set
7. Assigning a variable to the column names within the combined set and looking for variables that include the strings: “mean”, “std” and the first 2 column name. This produces a variable that has the column numbers with those variables
8. creating a subset with the columns found in step 7
9. Creating a new activity array that has the activity name assigned to the activity number and replacing it within the subset
9. renaming the column names within the subset to descriptive variable names
10.  saving the subset as a data table “Tidy_Subset.txt”
